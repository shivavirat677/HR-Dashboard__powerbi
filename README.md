2. Average Salary and Gender Distribution: Provides an insight into average salary across departments and gender ratios, allowing HR to assess pay equity and diversity.


3. Departmental Headcount: A bar chart showcasing the headcount across different departments, helping to identify departments with high or low staffing levels.


4. Headcount by Age Group and Marital Status: Visualizes the age distribution and marital status of employees, aiding in understanding workforce demographics.


5. Recruitment Source Analysis: Analyzes the effectiveness of recruitment sources, enabling optimization of recruitment strategies.


6. Yearly Trends: Line graphs displaying trends over time for headcount and attrition, helping in tracking historical changes.



Purpose of the Dashboard: This dashboard is designed to provide HR managers and executives with a real-time view of workforce dynamics.
